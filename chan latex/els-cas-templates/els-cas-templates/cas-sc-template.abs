Due to their abundance in calcium, vitamins, and minerals, vegetables are known to have a wide range of health benefits for the human body, and several studies on their nutritional worth have been carried out. One must be able to precisely recognise and classify each vegetable in order to completely understand its subtleties, which is a challenging process. The use of deep learning techniques and several complex models has greatly improved this activity. Well-known deep learning models including Resnet, Vgg, Alexnet, Squeezenet, Shufflenet, Googlenet, Densenet, and Resnet50 are used in this discipline. In order to automate vegetable identification, these models are made to separate and group a variety of vegetable characteristics and properties.The effectiveness of these deep learning models is ultimately determined by their precision after training. The more accurately the model can categorise and detect vegetables, the more accurate it will be. One model, the Resnet50, has emerged as a standout performer after extensive analysis and testing. It has proven to have a record of 0.999333\% accuracy that is unequalled. Due to its remarkable accuracy, which surpasses that of all other classifiers examined, Resnet50 is the best choice for precisely categorising and recognising vegetables.The abundance of health advantages provided by vegetables, in conclusion, emphasises the significance of precise identification and classification. This approach has undergone a revolution because to deep learning, which uses models like Resnet50 to achieve accuracy rates that are higher than any others. As a result, we are better equipped to recognise and utilise the nutritive potential of vegetables for human welfare.
