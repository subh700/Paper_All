abstract = {Urban environments globally are under threat due to recent climate changes caused by a variety of factors such as growing industrialization, rapid migration, increasing traffic flow, etc. An effective data-driven air pollution modeling system helps in increasing regular awareness regarding the severity of the air quality at the local level, play a preventive role in addressing the root causes and hence can be extremely useful for the urban administration. Graph Neural Networks have recently emerged for various classification and estimation tasks on graph-structured data. A Spatially Attentive Cluster-based Graph Neural Network-enabled PM2.5 concentration forecasting model (SA-GNN) is proposed to predict short-term PM2.5 concentrations by considering monitoring stations as nodes of a graph structure and exploring their spatial relationships. This modeling procedure takes into account relevant meteorological variables like wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity etc. An efficient clustering-based spatiotemporal feature extraction method is proposed within a graph neural network setting. This technique makes use of cluster-wise separated graph-structured spatiotemporal features by utilizing disjoint intermediate spatiotemporal GRU networks in order to handle spatial heterogeneity. Additionally, the use of graph attentional network (GATs) makes the modeling framework efficient. The proposed short-term PM2.5 concentrations forecasting framework is applied to the highly polluted Indian capital city, Delhi. The proposed SA-GNN model achieves R2 value 0.75, RMSE and MAE, 25.13 and 21.28 μg/m3 respectively on test data, achieving significant improvement with respect to the baseline models. In fact, even the high pollution episodes can be predicted by the SA-GNN model with better accuracy. Evidently, the proposed GNN-based air pollution modeling framework can be a potential option for forecasting of pollutants in other similar cities globally with high pollution records.}

abstract = {Nowadays, real-time air pollution monitoring has been an important approach for supporting pollution control and reduction. However, due to the high construction cost and limited detection range of monitoring stations, not all the air pollutant concentrations in every corner can be monitored, and a whole picture of the spatial distribution of air pollution is usually lacked for comprehensive spatial analysis and air quality control. To address this problem, satellite remote sensing and spatial interpolation/extrapolation technologies have been commonly used in past research. However, the spatial distribution calculated by remote sensing techniques could be less accurate due to the limited amount of recorded data for testing and adjustments. Performance of traditional spatial interpolation/extrapolation techniques, such as Kriging and IDW, was limited by several subjective assumptions and pre-set formulations that are less suitable for non-linear real-world situations. As an alternative, machine learning and neural network-based methods have been proposed recently. However, most of these methods failed to well consider the long short temporal trend and spatial associations of air pollution simultaneously. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposed a newly designed spatial interpolation/extrapolation methodology namely Geo-LSTM to generate the spatial distribution of air pollutant concentrations. The model was developed based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to capture the long-term dependencies of air quality. A geo-layer was designed to integrate the spatial-temporal correlation from other monitoring stations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a case study in Washington state was conducted. The experimental results show that Geo-LSTM has a RMSE of 0.0437, and is almost 60.13% better than traditional methods like IDW.}

abstract = {The Sichuan Basin (SCB) is severely polluted by fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Accurate PM2.5 concentration is important for pollution control and epidemiological studies. Evidence indicates that the distribution of PM2.5 is spatially clustered. Additionally, the high local variation in PM2.5 in densely populated areas indicates the necessity of high-resolution PM2.5 estimation. However, spatial clustering and local variation are not considered in current studies in the SCB, which may limit the prediction accuracy of PM2.5 estimation. In this study, we estimated the PM2.5 concentration at 0.01° (approximately 1 km) resolution using a random forest model with data-driven spatial autocorrelation terms (DDW-RF) considering both the first-law-of-geography-based similarity and spatial clustering of PM2.5. The repeated 10-fold cross-validations revealed that compared to the traditional RF model, the optimal model had an 18.31% decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) and a 4.68% increase in the coefficient of determination (R2). The distribution of PM2.5 revealed another heavily polluted area in the northeastern SCB, including Nanchong and Dazhou besides the two commonly known heavily PM2.5 polluted areas in the western and southern SCB. Then, we built a downscaled model in the megacity Chengdu, which estimated PM2.5 at 0.001° resolution with a 0.156 μg/m3 (1.72%) decrease in RMSE compared to those of 0.01° estimations. The accurate and high-resolution PM2.5 estimates generated by DDW-RF and downscaled models in this study could be beneficial for accurate health effect estimation not only in the whole SCB but also in the city areas with high variable concentrations.}

abstract = {PM2.5 forecasting has always been difficult. Neural networks are widely used in the forecasting of PM2.5, however, the accuracy is not satisfactory due to uncertainty. In order to solve this problem, a new PM2.5 forecasting system based on data preprocessing, combined neural network, and the unconstrained weighting method based on an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed. A new chaotic map is introduced to our model to improve the traditional population initialization. In addition, a new unconstrained weighting method was proposed, and a combination of MAPE value (prediction accuracy) and STD value (prediction stability) were set as the objective functions. The predicted results of each neural network were judged by statistical index and a dynamic weight was given to different neural networks to achieve the optimal prediction result. We demonstrated the superiority, accuracy and generalization ability of our proposed model through experiments on the PM2.5 data of four cities around the Bohai Economic Belt in China: Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, and Yantai.}

abstract = {In recent, air pollution has a sever impact on public health and economy development throughout the world. Air pollution consists of a variety of harming components, of which fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is considered to be one of the causes of health concerns. Under this circumstance, accurate prediction of atmospheric pollutant concentrations has become a hot research hotspot in the academic field of environment. The frequent changes of different factors cause random fluctuations in the concentration of PM2.5, which brings difficulties to the control of the concentration of air pollutants. By predicting concentration values within different areas and understanding the changes about PM2.5 concentrations, we can effectively warn and take actions to fluctuations in PM2.5 concentrations and help environment policy decision-makers provide sufficient information to guide their decisions. A hybrid model combining XGBoost, four GARCH models and MLP model（XGBoost-GARCH-MLP）is proposed to predict PM2.5 concentration values and volatility. The experimental research results show that the volatility forecasting model proposed in this study has good performance in the long-term forecasting process. If the volatility is used as the PM2.5 concentration prediction benchmark, a better prediction result will be obtained. In conclusion, the model established in this study can more effectively predict PM2.5 concentrations and fluctuations in different regions.}

abstract = {Deep learning models address air quality forecasting problems far more effectively and efficiently than the traditional machine learning models. Specifically, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) constitute a significant breakthrough in understanding the complex sequential behavioral dependencies of the time series. Further, LSTM models justify well with the speed–accuracy tradeoff, among other deep learning models. However, there are several limitations of such deep learning models. Firstly, the addition of multiple hidden layers, on the one hand, improves the performance but, on the other hand, requires extensive hardware and computation capabilities. Secondly, most of the previous works that utilized LSTMs for air quality forecasting do not consider the issue of optimal hyperparameter calibration. While deciding the gradient, network learning parameters should be so fixed such that the model does not underfit or overfit. To address these issues, a stochastic optimization algorithm, mimicking the pattern of flocking birds, is utilized to find the most fitting solution in the parameter search space. Particle swarm optimization setup primarily models varying particles representing parameters to reach an optimum state. Furthermore, the Spatio-temporal instabilities of LSTM models are addressed in this work using preprocessing, segmentation and feature engineering to understand seasonal and trend characteristics along with the Spatio-temporal correlation of the time series. The proposed model is employed on the air quality dataset of 15 locations in India. A variety of experiments are performed to prove the superiority of the proposed method. Firstly, a comparison with traditional sequential models and deep learning models is done. Secondly, results are further evaluated over several existing benchmark dataset samples. Results suggest that the proposed method outperforms existing forecasting models when evaluated over a variety of performance metrics.}
