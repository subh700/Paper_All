Pollution is a growing worldwide problem that endangers the environment \cite{Fortunato2010}, human health, and biodiversity. It manifests itself in a variety of ways, including air pollution caused by car emissions and industrial operations, water pollution caused by chemical runoff and inappropriate waste disposal, and soil contamination caused by dangerous chemicals and poor agricultural practices. These pollutants not only harm the quality of natural resources but also contribute to climate change and ozone layer depletion. Pollution must be addressed collectively by tough legislation, sustainable practices, and the use of eco-friendly technology. We can protect the earth for future generations and build a cleaner, healthier environment for everybody if we recognize the seriousness of the problem and take responsible action.
Air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, noise pollution, and light pollution are all examples of pollution. Air pollution is one of the most serious and pressing issues, owing to its extensive influence on human health and the environment. Particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or smaller, generally referred to as $PM_{2.5}$, is very important in terms of air pollution. These microscopic particles may readily enter our respiratory system and penetrate deep into the lungs, producing a variety of health concerns such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disease, and even early death. $PM_{2.5}$ is an important aspect in air quality monitoring and mitigation activities since lowering its levels is key for improving public health and the overall health of our planet.
