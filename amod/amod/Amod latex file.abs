Today's growing global population relies on energy to meet routine necessities and activities. Renewable energy sources, particularly solar power, have the potential to meet global energy demand while lessening the adverse effects of traditional sources on global warming. The most significant component of solar energy applications is solar radiation. On the other hand, access to solar radiation is regulated by several criteria, including prediction timeframes, weather categorisation, and assessment metrics, all of which should be carefully considered. Precision irradiation from the sun prediction is essential for power system designers and grid operators to operate solar-generating projects properly. Because sunlight is irregular and unpredictable, traditional statistical and machine learning methodologies frequently fail to provide meaningful estimations. Researchers in this field have employed deep learning models to solve the shortcomings of existing machine learning algorithms and improve prediction accuracy. It studies time series analysis as well as forecasting short-term solar irradiation. The primary objective is to develop forecasting models that hybridise DL techniques with data from various sources. The purpose is to anticipate solar irradiance at a specific location in India over 23 years (2001-2023). The power project delves archive contains data on daily solar exposure.
The proposed approach for measuring solar irradiation uses time series analysis with DL models. The dataset spans 23 years and provides daily records of sun irradiation for several places across India. The first critical step in our investigation is to normalise solar irradiance data. Based on time series explored characteristics, hybrid DL models such as CNN-RNN and GRU-BiLSTM-LSTM have been proposed compared to stand-alone DL models. CNN, RNN, BILSTM, LSTM, and GRU all increased prediction accuracy by 2.92\%, 1.54, 1.06\%, 0.7\%, 0.4557\%, and 0.21\%, respectively. This article provides fundamental principles that may be a foundation for implementing DL models. Field researchers and engineers might use these principles to enhance solar PV facility modelling and design, increasing solar energy consumption.
