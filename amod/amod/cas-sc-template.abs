In today's society, the growing global population is largely reliant on energy to meet their daily needs and activities. Renewable energy, particularly solar energy, has the potential to meet global energy demand while lessening the negative effects of traditional sources on global warming. The most significant component of solar energy applications is solar radiation. Access to solar radiation, on the other hand, is regulated by a number of criteria, including prediction timeframes, weather categorization, and assessment metrics, all of which should be carefully considered. Precision solar irradiance prediction is essential for power system designers and grid operators to properly operate solar generating projects. Because of the intermittent and non-continuous character of solar irradiation, traditional statistical and machine learning methodologies frequently fail to provide meaningful estimations. Researchers in this field have employed deep learning models to overcome the limitations of classic machine learning techniques and increase prediction accuracy. This study delves into time series analysis as well as forecasting short-term solar irradiation. The primary objective is to develop forecasting models that mix deep learning techniques with data from various sources. The purpose is to anticipate solar irradiance at a specific location in India over a 23-year period (2001-2023) using daily solar radiation data obtained from NASA's POWER project repository.  Time series analysis and deep learning models are used in the proposed approach for measuring solar irradiation. The dataset utilized covers 23 years and contains daily data on solar irradiation for many Indian towns.
  The first step is to normalize solar irradiance data using All Sky Surface UVA and ALL Sky Surface UVB data, which both have annual periodic time series patterns. The normalized solar irradiance data is then characterized using time series analysis methods such as bar graphs, scatter plots, box plots, and mutual information analysis. These studies help us understand the underlying features of normalized sun irradiance data. Based on these findings, an in-depth examination of deep learning models is offered. Long-short-term memory (LSTM), deep belief networks, echo state networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are examples of such models. Previous research has shown that deep learning models can improve prediction skills. Several research show that combining approaches, namely CNN-RNN and GRU-BILSTM-LSTM, can improve prediction accuracy even more. CNN, RNN, BILSTM, LSTM, and GRU all increased prediction accuracy by 2.92\%, 1.54\%, 1.06\%, 0.7\%, 0.4557\%, and 0.21\%, respectively. This article provides fundamental principles that may be used as a foundation for implementing deep learning techniques in general. Field researchers and engineers might use these principles to enhance the modeling and design of solar photovoltaic plants, hence increasing solar energy consumption.
